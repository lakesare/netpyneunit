The netpyne sim is taken from Gili Karni's excellent medium post:

The only difference betweeen hers and our model is the number of neurons - she used 200 (see 'numCells'), and we used 10 to speed up the model (hers runs for 10 minutes, ours for a few seconds).
Additionally, our model is beautified - if you'd like to read the proper description of the model and see the comments in code, please head to her post.
